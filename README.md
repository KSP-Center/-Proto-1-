# -Proto-1-
This is the main script file for out first robot in the 2024-2025 VEX Robotics season.

For Context: VEX Robotics is a robotics competition which brings the minds of differentR
people to create a solution using STEM methods by building a robot to score as many points
as possible in the game (the game changes every year, so dont expect a returning robot).
These different minds, colectivly known as a team, have very strict constraints to apply
to when building these robots, as listed:

- Robots must be within a 18x18x18 inch space
- Robots must use VEX-made components (both eletrical and mechanical)
- No modifications to VEX electronics are allowed (except in VEX U)
- No materials other than VEX parts are allowed (except in VEX U)
- THIS ISNT BATTLEBOTS PEOPLE
- EVERY action to the robot or robot-related components are done by the team
