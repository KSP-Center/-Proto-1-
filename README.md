# -Proto-1-
This is the main script file for out first robot in the 2024-2025 VEX Robotics season.

# About VEX Robotics
VEX Robotics is a robotics competition which brings the minds of differentR
people to create a solution using STEM methods by building a robot to score as many points
as possible in the game (the game changes every year, so dont expect a returning robot).
These different minds, colectivly known as a team, have very strict constraints to apply
to when building these robots, as listed:

- Robots must be within a 18x18x18 inch space
- Robots must use VEX-made components (both eletrical and mechanical)
- No modifications to VEX electronics are allowed (except in VEX U)
- No materials other than VEX parts are allowed (except in VEX U)
- THIS ISNT BATTLEBOTS PEOPLE
- EVERY action to the robot or robot-related components are done by the team

What is the ultimate goal of VEX Robotics? To create and bring activities using STEM
to classrooms around the world for better education purposes.

# Actual Project
This repository contains the necessary code to correctly run a skills (maybe auton)
match using probably the worlds first VEX Robotics AI, written completly by hand by
yours truely, and a buddy of mine (you can find him @trainlover08). The main scripting
and simulation to train the AI was made by me, while the actual AI itself was written
by my buddy. As a few added bonuses, this contains extraa functions for motor temps,
a built-in pause command for movement operations by hand without exiting the program, 
and a install check for checking that all sensors and motors are installed as they
should be.

# How to use:
Before we get started, we need to figure out what software you use. There are 2 softwares
that VEX programmers use to code:
- Visual Studio Code
- VEXcode V5 (or VEXcode Pro V5)
If you dont have any of the softwares installed, go ahead and install Visual Studio Code
(VS Code for short). I dont recommend getting VEXcode V5 because VS Code allows more felxibility
in what your coding and how the program is setup. Once you have VS Code installed, continue to
the 'Visual Studio Use' tab. If on VEXcode V5, scroll down until you hit 'VEXcode Use'
